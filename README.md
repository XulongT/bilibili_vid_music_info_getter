# What is this?
This is a script for fetching videos from the Bilibili website. To facilitate the collection of videos and the data associated with the music used, I have added functionality to retrieve information about the music in the videos, as well as other information related to videos that use similar music.
# How to use?
Just run main.py and then type in the bv number!
# Any other question?
Just ask me lol
